<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Tokamak API exposes two different types of classes. The Interface classes 
  are classes of objects which must be created and freed through a Tokamak API 
  function or a member function of a Tokamak class. The other group, Peripheral 
  classes, consists of ordinary C++ classes which are managed by the API user.</p>
<p>Note: the Tokamak API is written in C++ and is of an object-oriented design. 
  But it keeps the use of virtual class functions to an absolute minimum. Internally, 
  there are no virtual functions at all. The rationale behind this design decision 
  is that on some platforms virtual function calls are very costly due to limited 
  cache space. Thus, we have taken care that Tokamak does create virtual function 
  call overhead.</p>
