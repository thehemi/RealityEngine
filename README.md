# Reality Source

Reality is the engine Unity was based on (C# scripting was my idea first :P), and that Epic bought

Use for learning, just a dump, haven't tried to get it working yet. I swear, this was, and still is, one of the finest game engines ever built. From the tooling, editor, pipeline, scripting, everything. If I get time I'll put the tutorials ane media online.

Reality was used for:

 * My Horse And Me
 * Cell Factor demos from NVIDIA
 * Lots of games

This is era 12/2004. Unfortunately most changes making it commercial came quickly over the next 5 months, but my source is corrupt. Hey, it's something. I will accept any and all pull requests to try and make anything useful of this.
