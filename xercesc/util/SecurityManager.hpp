 * $Log: SecurityManager.hpp,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2004/01/29 11:48:46  cargilld
 * Code cleanup changes to get rid of various compiler diagnostic messages.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/04/22 12:53:38  neilg
 * change const static member to an enum to make MSVC happy
 *
 * change ENTITY_EXPANSION_LIMIT from a static const data member to an enum
 * 
 * Revision 1.1  2003/04/17 21:58:49  neilg
 * Adding a new property,
 * http://apache.org/xml/properties/security-manager, with
 * appropriate getSecurityManager/setSecurityManager methods on DOM
 * and SAX parsers.  Also adding a new SecurityManager class.
 *
 * The purpose of these modifications is to permit applications a
 * means to have the parser reject documents whose processing would
 * otherwise consume large amounts of system resources.  Malicious
 * use of such documents could be used to launch a denial-of-service
 * attack against a system running the parser.  Initially, the
 * SecurityManager only knows about attacks that can result from
 * exponential entity expansion; this is the only known attack that
 * involves processing a single XML document.  Other, simlar attacks
 * can be launched if arbitrary schemas may be parsed; there already
 * exist means (via use of the EntityResolver interface) by which
 * applications can deny processing of untrusted schemas.  In future,
 * the SecurityManager will be expanded to take these other exploits
 * into account.
 *
 * Initial checkin of SecurityManager
