    //      NOTE: There may be dups of the extCh field, since there might be
    //      multiple Unicode code points which map to the same external code
    //      point. Normally this won't happen, since the parser assumes that
    //      internalization is normalized, but we have to be prepared to do
    //      the right thing if some client code gives us non-normalized data
    //      itself.
