  * Receive notification of general document events.
  *
  * <p>This is the main interface that most SAX applications
  * implement: if the application needs to be informed of basic parsing
  * events, it implements this interface and registers an instance with
  * the SAX parser using the setDocumentHandler method.  The parser
  * uses the instance to report basic document-related events like
  * the start and end of elements and character data.</p>
  *
  * <p>The order of events in this interface is very important, and
  * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
  * example, all of an element's content (character data, processing
  * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
  * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.</p>
  *
  * <p>Application writers who do not want to implement the entire
  * interface while can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements
  * the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate
  * HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find
  * the location of any document event using the Locator interface
  * supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.</p>
