  * Receive notification of basic DTD-related events.
  *
  * <p>If a SAX application needs information about notations and
  * unparsed entities, then the application implements this
  * interface and registers an instance with the SAX parser using
  * the parser's setDTDHandler method.  The parser uses the
  * instance to report notation and unparsed entity declarations to
  * the application.</p>
  *
  * <p>The SAX parser may report these events in any order, regardless
  * of the order in which the notations and unparsed entities were
  * declared; however, all DTD events must be reported after the
  * document handler's startDocument event, and before the first
  * startElement event.</p>
  *
  * <p>It is up to the application to store the information for
  * future use (perhaps in a hash table or object tree).
  * If the application encounters attributes of type "NOTATION",
  * "ENTITY", or "ENTITIES", it can use the information that it
  * obtained through this interface to find the entity and/or
  * notation corresponding with the attribute value.</p>
  *
  * <p>The HandlerBase class provides a default implementation
  * of this interface, which simply ignores the events.</p>
