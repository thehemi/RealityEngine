/**
  * Interface for an element's attribute specifications.
  *
  * The SAX parser implements this interface and passes an instance
  * to the SAX application as the second argument of each startElement
  * event.
  *
  * The instance provided will return valid results only during the
  * scope of the startElement invocation (to save it for future
  * use, the application must make a copy: the AttributeListImpl
  * helper class provides a convenient constructor for doing so).
  *
  * An AttributeList includes only attributes that have been
  * specified or defaulted: #IMPLIED attributes will not be included.
  *
  * There are two ways for the SAX application to obtain information
  * from the AttributeList.  First, it can iterate through the entire
  * list:
  *
  * <pre>
  * public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) {
  *   for (int i = 0; i < atts.getLength(); i++) {
  *     String name = atts.getName(i);
  *     String type = atts.getType(i);
  *     String value = atts.getValue(i);
  *     [...]
  *   }
  * }
  * </pre>
  *
  * (Note that the result of getLength() will be zero if there
  * are no attributes.)
  *
  * As an alternative, the application can request the value or
  * type of specific attributes:
  *
  * <pre>
  * public void startElement (String name, AttributeList atts) {
  *   String identifier = atts.getValue("id");
  *   String label = atts.getValue("label");
  *   [...]
  * }
  * </pre>
  *
  * The AttributeListImpl helper class provides a convenience
  * implementation for use by parser or application writers.
  *
  * @see DocumentHandler#startElement
  * @see AttributeListImpl#AttributeListImpl
