/**
  * Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
  *
  * <p>If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
  * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
  * passing an instance to the application using the document
  * handler's setDocumentLocator method.  The application can use the
  * object to obtain the location of any other document handler event
  * in the XML source document.</p>
  *
  * <p>Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
  * during the scope of each document handler method: the application
  * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
  * locator at any other time.</p>
  *
  * <p>SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
  * very strong encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
  * locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
  * If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
  * the startDocument event, the application should assume that a
  * locator is not available.</p>
