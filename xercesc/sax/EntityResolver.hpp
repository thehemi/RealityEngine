/**
  * Basic interface for resolving entities.
  *
  * <p>If a SAX application needs to implement customized handling
  * for external entities, it must implement this interface and
  * register an instance with the SAX parser using the parser's
  * setEntityResolver method.</p>
  *
  * <p>The parser will then allow the application to intercept any
  * external entities (including the external DTD subset and external
  * parameter entities, if any) before including them.</p>
  *
  * <p>Many SAX applications will not need to implement this interface,
  * but it will be especially useful for applications that build
  * XML documents from databases or other specialised input sources,
  * or for applications that use URI types other than URLs.</p>
  *
  * <p>The following resolver would provide the application
  * with a special character stream for the entity with the system
  * identifier "http://www.myhost.com/today":</p>
  *
  *<pre>
  *#include <xercesc/sax/EntityResolver.hpp>
  *#include <xercesc/sax/InputSource.hpp>
  *
  *class MyResolver : public EntityResolver {
  *  public:
  *    InputSource resolveEntity (const XMLCh* const publicId,
  *                               const XMLCh* const systemId);
  *   ...
  *   };
  *
  *  MyResolver::resolveEntity {
  *    if (XMLString::compareString(systemId, "http://www.myhost.com/today")) {
  *      MyReader* reader = new MyReader();
  *      return new InputSource(reader);
  *    } else {
  *      return null;
  *    }
  *  }
  *
  *</pre>
  *
  * <p>The application can also use this interface to redirect system
  * identifiers to local URIs or to look up replacements in a catalog
  * (possibly by using the public identifier).</p>
  *
  * <p>The HandlerBase class implements the default behaviour for
  * this interface, which is simply always to return null (to request
  * that the parser use the default system identifier).</p>

    * element): the application may request that the parser resolve
    * the entity itself, that it use an alternative URI, or that it
    * use an entirely different input source.</p>
    *
    * <p>Application writers can use this method to redirect external
    * system identifiers to secure and/or local URIs, to look up

    * database or other input source (including, for example, a dialog

    *         URI connection to the system identifier.
