/**
 *  This class is a derivative of the standard InputSource class. It provides
 *  for the parser access to data stored in a memory buffer. The type of
 *  buffer and its host specific attributes are of little concern here. The
 *  only real requirement is that the memory be readable by the current
 *  process.
 *
 *  Note that the memory buffer size is expressed in <b>bytes</b>, not in
 *  characters. If you pass it text data, you must account for the bytes
 *  per character when indicating the buffer size.
 *
 *  As with all InputSource derivatives. The primary objective of an input
 *  source is to create an input stream via which the parser can spool in
 *  data from the referenced source. In this case, there are two options
 *  available.
 *
 *  The passed buffer can be adopted or merely referenced. If it is adopted,
 *  then it must be dynamically allocated and will be destroyed when the
 *  input source is destroyed (no reference counting!.) If not adopted, the
 *  caller must insure that it remains valid until the input source object
 *  is destroyed.
 *
 *  The other option indicates whether each stream created for this input
 *  source should get its own copy of the data, or whether it should just
 *  stream the data directly from this object's copy of the data. The same
 *  rules apply here, in that the buffer must either be copied by the
 *  stream or it must remain valid until the stream is destroyed.
