/**
 *  This class is a derivative of the standard InputSource class. It provides
 *  for the parser access to data which is referenced via a local file path,
 *  as apposed to remote file or URL. This is the most efficacious mechanism
 *  by which local files can be parsed, since the parse knows that it refers
 *  to a local file and will make no other attempts to interpret the passed
 *  path.
 *
 *  The path provided can either be a fully qualified path or a relative path.
 *  If relative, it will be completed either relative to a passed base path
 *  or relative to the current working directory of the process.
 *
 *  As with all InputSource derivatives. The primary objective of an input
 *  source is to create an input stream via which the parser can spool in
 *  data from the referenced source.
