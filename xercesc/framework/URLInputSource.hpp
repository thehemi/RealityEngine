/**
 *  This class is a derivative of the standard InputSource class. It provides
 *  for the parser access to data which is referenced via a URL, as apposed to
 *  a local file name. The URL can be provided via an XMLURL class, as a fully
 *  qualified system id, or a base system id and a system id which may be
 *  fully qualified or may be relative to the base.
 *
 *  As with all InputSource derivatives. The primary objective of an input
 *  source is to create an input stream via which the parser can spool in
 *  data from the referenced source.
 *
 *  Note that the parse system does not necessarily support URL based XML
 *  entities out of the box. Support for socket based access is optional and
 *  controlled by the per-platform support.
