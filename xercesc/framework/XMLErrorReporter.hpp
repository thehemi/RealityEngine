/**
 *  This abstract class defines a callback mechanism for the scanner. By
 *  creating a class that implements this interface and plugging an instance
 *  of that class into the scanner, the scanner will call back on the object's
 *  virtual methods to report error events. This class is also used with the
 *  validator, to allow it to report errors.
 *
 *  This class is primarily for use by those writing their own parser classes.
 *  If you use the standard parser classes, DOMParser and SAXParser, you won't
 *  use this API. You will instead use a similar mechanism defined by the SAX
 *  API, called ErrorHandler.

      * This method is called back on by the scanner or validator (or any other
      * internal parser component which might need to report an error in the
      * future.) It contains all the information that the client code might
      * need to report or log the error.
      *
      * @param  errCode     The error code of the error being reported. What
      *                     this means is dependent on the domain it is from.
      *
      * @param  errDomain   The domain from which the error occured. The domain
      *                     is a means of providing a hierarchical layering to
      *                     the error system, so that a single set of error id
      *                     numbers don't have to be split up.
      *
      * @param  type        The error type, which is defined mostly by XML which
      *                     categorizes errors into warning, errors and validity
      *                     constraints.
      *
      * @param  errorText   The actual text of the error. This is translatable,
      *                     so can possibly be in the local language if a
      *                     translation has been provided.
      *
      * @param  systemId    The system id of the entity where the error occured,
      *                     fully qualified.
      *
      * @param  publicId    The optional public id of the entity were the error
      *                     occured. It can be an empty string if non was provided.
      *
      * @param  lineNum     The line number within the source XML of the error.
      *
      * @param  colNum      The column number within the source XML of the error.
      *                     Because of the parsing style, this is usually just
      *                     after the actual offending text.
