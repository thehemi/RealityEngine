  * DOMEntityResolver provides a way for applications to redirect references

  * <p>Applications needing to implement customized handling for external
  * entities must implement this interface and register their implementation
  * by setting the entityResolver attribute of the DOMBuilder.</p>
  *
  * <p>The DOMBuilder will then allow the application to intercept any
  * external entities (including the external DTD subset and external parameter
  * entities) before including them.</p>
  *
  * <p>Many DOM applications will not need to implement this interface, but it
  * will be especially useful for applications that build XML documents from
  * databases or other specialized input sources, or for applications that use
  * URNs.</p>
