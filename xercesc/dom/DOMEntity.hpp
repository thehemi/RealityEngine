/**
 * This interface represents an entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an XML
 * document. Note that this models the entity itself not the entity
 * declaration. <code>DOMEntity</code> declaration modeling has been left for a
 * later Level of the DOM specification.
 * <p>The <code>nodeName</code> attribute that is inherited from
 * <code>DOMNode</code> contains the name of the entity.
 * <p>An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before the
 * structure model is passed to the DOM; in this case there will be no
 * <code>DOMEntityReference</code> nodes in the document tree.
 * <p>XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and
 * process entity declarations made in the external subset or declared in
 * external parameter entities. This means that parsed entities declared in
 * the external subset need not be expanded by some classes of applications,
 * and that the replacement value of the entity may not be available. When
 * the replacement value is available, the corresponding <code>DOMEntity</code>
 * node's child list represents the structure of that replacement text.
 * Otherwise, the child list is empty.
 * <p>The DOM Level 2 does not support editing <code>DOMEntity</code> nodes; if a
 * user wants to make changes to the contents of an <code>DOMEntity</code>,
 * every related <code>DOMEntityReference</code> node has to be replaced in the
 * structure model by a clone of the <code>DOMEntity</code>'s contents, and
 * then the desired changes must be made to each of those clones instead.
 * <code>DOMEntity</code> nodes and all their descendants are readonly.
 * <p>An <code>DOMEntity</code> node does not have any parent.If the entity
 * contains an unbound namespace prefix, the <code>namespaceURI</code> of
 * the corresponding node in the <code>DOMEntity</code> node subtree is
 * <code>null</code>. The same is true for <code>DOMEntityReference</code>
 * nodes that refer to this entity, when they are created using the
 * <code>createEntityReference</code> method of the <code>DOMDocument</code>
 * interface. The DOM Level 2 does not support any mechanism to resolve
 * namespace prefixes.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a>.
