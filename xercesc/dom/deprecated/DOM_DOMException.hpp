/**
  * Encapsulate a general DOM error or warning.
  *
  * <p> The DOM will create and throw an instance of DOMException
  * when an error condition is detected.  Exceptions can occur
  * when an application directly manipulates the DOM document
  * tree that is produced by the parser, or when a document tree
  * is created from scratch using the DOM API.  DOM exceptions will
  * not be generated by the parser while constructing a document
  * tree from an XML source document.
  *
  * <p>Unlike the other classes in the C++ DOM API, DOM_DOMException
  * is NOT a reference to an underlying implementation class, and
  * does not provide automatic memory management.  Code that catches
  * a DOM exception is responsible for deleting it, or otherwise
  * arranging for its disposal.
