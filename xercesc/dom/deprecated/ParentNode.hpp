/**
 * ParentNode inherits from ChildImpl and adds the capability of having child
 * nodes. Not every node in the DOM can have children, so only nodes that can
 * should inherit from this class and pay the price for it.
 * <P>
 * ParentNode, just like NodeImpl, also implements NodeList, so it can
 * return itself in response to the getChildNodes() query. This eliminiates
 * the need for a separate ChildNodeList object. Note that this is an
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL; applications should _never_ assume that
 * this identity exists.
 * <P>
 * While we have a direct reference to the first child, the last child is
 * stored as the previous sibling of the first child. First child nodes are
 * marked as being so, and getNextSibling hides this fact.
 * <P>Note: Not all parent nodes actually need to also be a child. At some
 * point we used to have ParentNode inheriting from NodeImpl and another class
 * called ChildAndParentNode that inherited from ChildNode. But due to the lack
 * of multiple inheritance a lot of code had to be duplicated which led to a
 * maintenance nightmare. At the same time only a few nodes (Document,
 * DocumentFragment, Entity, and Attribute) cannot be a child so the gain is
 * memory wasn't really worth it. The only type for which this would be the
 * case is Attribute, but we deal with there in another special way, so this is
 * not applicable.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING</b>: Some of the code here is partially duplicated in
 * AttrImpl, be careful to keep these two classes in sync!
