/**
* The <code>DOM_Attr</code> class refers to an attribute of an XML element.
*
* Typically the allowable values for the
* attribute are defined in a documenttype definition.
* <p><code>DOM_Attr</code> objects inherit the <code>DOM_Node</code>  interface, but
* since attributes are not actually child nodes of the elements they are associated with, the
* DOM does not consider them part of the document  tree.  Thus, the
* <code>DOM_Node</code> attributes <code>parentNode</code>,
* <code>previousSibling</code>, and <code>nextSibling</code> have a  null
* value for <code>DOM_Attr</code> objects. The DOM takes the  view that
* attributes are properties of elements rather than having a  separate
* identity from the elements they are associated with;  this should make it
* more efficient to implement such features as default attributes associated
* with all elements of a  given type.  Furthermore, attribute nodes
* may not be immediate children of a <code>DocumentFragment</code>. However,
* they can be associated with <code>Element</code> nodes contained within a
* <code>DocumentFragment</code>. In short, users of the DOM
* need to be aware that  <code>Attr</code> nodes have some things in  common
* with other objects inheriting the <code>Node</code> interface, but they
* also are quite distinct.
