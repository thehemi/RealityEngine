/**
 * OMDocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal"
 * DOMDocument object.
 *
 * It is very common to want to be able to
 * extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a
 * document. Imagine implementing a user command like cut or rearranging a
 * document by moving fragments around. It is desirable to have an object
 * which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural to use a DOMNode for
 * this purpose. While it is true that a <code>DOMDocument</code> object could
 * fulfil this role,  a <code>DOMDocument</code> object can potentially be a
 * heavyweight  object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is
 * really needed for this is a very lightweight object.
 * <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> is such an object.
 * <p>Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children
 * of another <code>DOMNode</code> -- may take <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code>
 * objects as arguments;  this results in all the child nodes of the
 * <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code>  being moved to the child list of this node.
 * <p>The children of a <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> node are zero or more
 * nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the
 * document. <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> nodes do not need to be
 * well-formed XML documents (although they do need to follow the rules
 * imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top
 * nodes).  For example, a <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> might have only one
 * child and that child node could be a <code>DOMText</code> node. Such a
 * structure model  represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML
 * document.
 * <p>When a <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> is inserted into a
 * <code>DOMDocument</code> (or indeed any other <code>DOMNode</code> that may take
 * children) the children of the <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> and not the
 * <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code>  itself are inserted into the
 * <code>DOMNode</code>. This makes the <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> very
 * useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the
 * <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code> acts as the parent of these nodes so that the
 *  user can use the standard methods from the <code>DOMNode</code>  interface,
 * such as <code>insertBefore()</code> and  <code>appendChild()</code>.
