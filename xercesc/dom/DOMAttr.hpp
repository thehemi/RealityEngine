/**
 * The <code>DOMAttr</code> class refers to an attribute of an XML element.
 *
 * Typically the allowable values for the
 * attribute are defined in a documenttype definition.
 * <p><code>DOMAttr</code> objects inherit the <code>DOMNode</code>  interface, but
 * since attributes are not actually child nodes of the elements they are associated with, the
 * DOM does not consider them part of the document  tree.  Thus, the
 * <code>DOMNode</code> attributes <code>parentNode</code>,
 * <code>previousSibling</code>, and <code>nextSibling</code> have a  null
 * value for <code>DOMAttr</code> objects. The DOM takes the  view that
 * attributes are properties of elements rather than having a  separate
 * identity from the elements they are associated with;  this should make it
 * more efficient to implement such features as default attributes associated
 * with all elements of a  given type.  Furthermore, attribute nodes
 * may not be immediate children of a <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code>. However,
 * they can be associated with <code>DOMElement</code> nodes contained within a
 * <code>DOMDocumentFragment</code>. In short, users of the DOM
 * need to be aware that  <code>DOMAttr</code> nodes have some things in  common
 * with other objects inheriting the <code>DOMNode</code> interface, but they
 * also are quite distinct.
